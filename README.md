# Professional README Generator

[How to create a Professional README](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)


## Description

This project is the result of a class assignment to create a README generator using some supplied code. I was told to create a README generator that can quickly create a professional README for a new project after collecting some user input. I needed to use a command line application that accepts user input via prompts for repository information and then produces a high quality professional README.md with the title of the project and the following sections: Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. The Title of the project will be desplayed as the title of the README. When the descirption, installation instructions, usage information, contributuion guidelines, and test instructions are entered then the information is added to the appropriate sections of the file. User should be able to select a license for the application from a list of options and a badge for that license is added near the top of the README along with a notice being added to the License section and an explanation of which license the application is covered under. The user's Github username and email should be input and added to the Questions section with a link to their Github Profile and instructions for contacting them for any aditional questions. Lastly, clicking on a section of the Table of Contents should take the reader to the corresponding section of the README.
